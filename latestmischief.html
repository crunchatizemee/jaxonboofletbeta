  <h2>Latest Mischief</h2>
  <p>On Tuesday, I escaped the female human's car during transit. I galloped around the neighborhood for the better part of an hour while she was frantically searching on foot. <em>FOOL.</em> I am much faster than her! I did injure my paws during my
    romp. <br><strong>8/10</strong> <em>Totally worth it.</em><br>
    <br>
    Thursday evening, the humans were seasoning chicken for a BBQ. While the female was in the bathroom, I was able to sneak and consume three of the four chicken breasts from the countertop. The humans were very upset and put me in my kennel for
    over an hour. I got a mild tummy ache from my full belly, probably from eating too quickly. <br><strong>10/10</strong> <em>Highly recommend, would do again.</em><br>
    <br>
    Friday night, the female was preparing batter for the male human's birthday cake. He offered me a lick from the rubber spoon and I took the whole rubber tip off and swallowed it promptly before they could protest. The humans were very concerned
    and fed me odd tasting bread, which I suspect caused me to throw up. <br><strong>3/10</strong> <em>Vomiting was uncomfortable, would probably do again though.</em></p>
